## My SQL project for Career Foundry
### Introduction: Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
#### Key Questions: 
##### ● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
##### ● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
##### ● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
##### ● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
##### ● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
#### Context: This project involves using SQL for in-depth data analysis to address queries from different departments, enhancing decision-making for the upcoming online service transition. Skills acquired here are transferable across industries, underscoring problem-solving abilities in data analytics.
#### Data Set: The dataset includes information on Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and transactions, loaded into a PostgreSQL database. It's structured to reflect real-world business scenarios and relationships between different data tables.
